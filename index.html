<h1> HOLA CORTOPOLLO</h1>
<p>



“Lorem ipsum” or ”Lorem ipsum dolor sit” is a reference to a chunk of Latin text used as filler, often in place of future text, for design purposes. It’s called that because those are the first words. The classic text is from Cicero, although it’s been scrambled enough to be barely decipherable. Lorem Ipsum was used for printing tests before the internet, but since everyone and his brother are designing websites now, we are more familiar with it than ever. And since we see it a lot, some designers are giving us alternatives to use as dummy text or to just give us a laugh. Let’s check out a few of them.
1. Riker Ipsum

Riker Ipsum generates text using lines of dialogue spoken by Commander William T. Riker in the TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation. Need more text? Hit the “more” button to add another sentence. They will be in no particular order.

    I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Your head is not an artifact! I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. You enjoyed that. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I am your worst nightmare! What? We're not at all alike! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me.

2. Yorkshire Ipsum

A thick Yorkshire accent is barely decipherable to those outside the area. Writing English phonetically to show the accent is just as difficult to read, so it may as well be a text placeholder, as in Yorkshire Ipsum. Some of the randomly-generated phrases may be NSFW in the strict sense, but I can’t tell.

    Where's tha bin. Will 'e 'eckerslike mardy bum bobbar. Face like a slapped arse soft lad dahn t'coil oil eeh wacken thi sen up soft southern pansy. Bobbar michael palin ah'll gi' thee a thick ear ne'ermind aye. Breadcake soft southern pansy tha daft apeth. Any rooad that's champion wacken thi sen up wacken thi sen up nay lad ah'll learn thi. God's own county nah then ne'ermind will 'e 'eckerslike ee by gum. Eeh appens as maybe appens as maybe ne'ermind. Th'art nesh thee is that thine be reet ee by gum. Sup wi' 'im shurrup.

3. Samuel L Ipsum

If you want to generate text that reminds you of the movie characters played by actor Samuel L. Jackson, you have your choice of generating “slipsum” with the original profanity intact in the classic version (even the landing page has NSFW text) or “slipsum lite” which only generates profanity-free quotes. The quotes are not censored, just chosen for content. It’s not even gibberish, but rants delivered by Samuel L. Jackson characters, in complete paragraphs.

    Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

4. Bacon Ipsum

Bacon Ipsum puts a little meat (or a lot of meat) into your placeholder text. It’s not all pork, and you can change the setting to add some Latin words to break up the nonstop carnivorage, like a palate cleanser. Warning: may cause hunger.

    Chuck swine jowl ham frankfurter. Chicken salami t-bone kevin chuck ribeye pork loin pancetta leberkas short ribs jowl frankfurter andouille. Hamburger ball tip ribeye beef ribs rump t-bone shankle meatloaf sirloin kevin pork loin. Alcatra chicken sausage pork loin. Tail corned beef cupim ball tip. Tenderloin jowl bresaola, porchetta boudin corned beef fatback chuck tongue leberkas beef jerky swine prosciutto. Landjaeger jerky tri-tip pastrami porchetta doner rump cow sirloin brisket capicola kielbasa frankfurter tenderloin venison.

If the “meat and filler” version is still too meaty for you, they recommend you try Veggie Ipsum instead.
